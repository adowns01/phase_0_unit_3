# U3.W7: Designing Schemas


#### I worked on this challenge by myself.


## Release 0: Student Roster Schema

## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: 

<!-- display your one-to-one image inline here -->
Every country only has one capital city and every capital city only has one country. (The only exception 
I know of is South Africa, which has three capitals, one for each branch of government.) Thus it is a one-to-one relationship.

<!-- display your many-to-many image inline here -->

Students typically take many classes at once (and thus have many teachers) and teachers have multiple students 
at one time. Thus the student to teacher relationship is many-to-many.

## Release 5: Reflection

I'm supposed to be honest, right? I found this challenge all at once dull, tedious, and frustraiting. Partially I just don't understand the whole point? It's nice seeing things visually, but is there a way to turn it directly into SQLite? My guess is that there is and I'm missing it... 
I'm looking forward to a time where I will be with teachers and peers where I can ask these questions and get a quick answer.
