### Reflection

This was my first experience with SQLite and it's...not what I thought. 

I def need a lot more work with it before I start feeling confident. I really liked the set of of SQLzoo, but I wish they explained each concept before just jumping into examples. I found that I really had to look elsewhere (like DBC said) to find more information to explain. 

My first instinct was to go somewhere I am comfortable, but sadly, codecademy doesn't have a SQLite track. 

This is the first challenge in this prep that I don't feel comfortable with.
