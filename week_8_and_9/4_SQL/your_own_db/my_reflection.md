I completed this challenge with Bridgette S.

I am very confused why the instructions had us do a join before we added any items to the database. My partner and I thought maybe we were supposed to insert a foreign key, not a join. We tried to insert a foreign key with no success. After writing the joins for the other SQL challenge, this one was no problem. 

Our code for adding each entry to the patients database was not very DRY though. If I were to do it again I would write a ruby code that would iterate through arrays with the values in it rather than write a INSERT VALUES for each pet.
